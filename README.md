# CodeSnippets

This is an app built using Electron that allows you to save code snippets in one place. The embedded CodeMirror module provides the syntax highlighting and I set it up to accomodate the more popular languages. There are many more but these are the ones that I currently have setup:

* Java 
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* Ruby
* .NET
* SQL
* C
* C++
* C#
* Swift
* Assembly
* PHP
* Fortran
* Objective-C
* MATLAB
* Powershell
* Pascal
* Lisp
* Scala
* LaTeX
